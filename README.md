# TeaJournal (WIP)
 Tea Journaling application written in C# using the .NET Windows Forms framework  
 CRUD implementation through SQL database, managed with SQLite.net PCL  
 
 Allows you to create and categorize teas, with fields for recording brewing instructions and general tasting notes.  
 
 TODO:
 - ~~Deletion functionality of tea entries~~
 - ~~Timer tool, to help keep track of currently brewing tea~~
 - Resizeable windows with scaling components
 - Overall theme changes (currently has all the ugly default application styles)
